in Java, the Map interface is a part of the java.util package and represents 
a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique. The Map interface 
has several implementations, each with different characteristics. Hereâ€™s a 
brief overview of the commonly used Map implementations:

1. HashMap
Characteristics:
    Stores elements in a hash table.
    Allows null values and one null key.
    Provides constant-time performance for basic operations like get and put (assuming the hash function disperses elements properly).
Usage:
    Best for general-purpose use where fast lookups and insertions are needed.

Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();

2. LinkedHashMap
Characteristics:
    Extends HashMap but maintains a doubly-linked list running through all entries.
    Maintains insertion order or access order.
    Slightly slower than HashMap due to the overhead of maintaining the linked list.
Usage:
    Useful when you need to maintain the order of elements.

Map<String, String> map = new LinkedHashMap<>();



3. TreeMap
Characteristics:
    Implements NavigableMap and is based on a Red-Black tree.
    Maintains keys in sorted order.
    Offers log(n) time cost for the basic operations (get, put, remove).
Usage:
    Useful when you need a sorted map or need to navigate keys in a sorted manner.

Map<String, String> map = new TreeMap<>();



4. Hashtable
Characteristics:
    Synchronized version of HashMap.
    Does not allow null keys or values.
    Legacy class, generally replaced by HashMap in non-thread-safe environments.
Usage:
    Used in scenarios where thread safety is a concern but ConcurrentHashMap is often preferred.

Map<String, String> map = new Hashtable<>();



5. ConcurrentHashMap
Characteristics:
    Part of java.util.concurrent package.
    Allows concurrent access by multiple threads.
    No need to lock the entire map for concurrent updates.
Usage:
    Ideal for high-concurrency scenarios.

Map<String, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();




6. WeakHashMap
Characteristics:
    Entries are stored using weak references to keys.
    Useful for memory-sensitive caches.
    When a key is no longer referenced, its entry is removed from the map.
Usage:
    Used for caching where keys should not prevent garbage collection.

Map<String, String> map = new WeakHashMap<>();



7. IdentityHashMap
Characteristics:
    Uses reference equality (==) instead of object equality (equals()).
    Allows null keys and values.
Usage:
    Suitable for scenarios where reference equality is required.

Map<String, String> map = new IdentityHashMap<>();

8. EnumMap
Characteristics:
    Specialized map implementation for use with enum type keys.
    Very efficient for enum keys as it internally uses an array.
Usage:
    Best used when the key set is an enum type.

Map<EnumType, String> map = new EnumMap<>(EnumType.class);

Summary
Each Map implementation has its strengths and is suitable for different scenarios:

Use HashMap for general-purpose, non-thread-safe collections.
Use LinkedHashMap when order matters.
Use TreeMap for sorted maps.
Use ConcurrentHashMap for concurrent access.
Use WeakHashMap for memory-sensitive caches.
Use IdentityHashMap for reference-based equality.
Use EnumMap for enum-based keys.
